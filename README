Design System Project - UX Designer Training at DIO

Building on the concept from the first project (a medium-fidelity wireframe), I developed a Design System for my app, "Ã‰quilibre Yoga." This was done by leveraging materials from the 'UX Designer Journey - DIO' and other resources I found online.
This fictional project was created as part of an evaluation for the "UX Designer Journey" course, taught by Professor Rodrigo Alexandre, on the DIO platform.
